<h1>About Us!</h1>
<p>We are a small team that wanted to make a beautiful alternative app installer that provides both signed and unsigned apps. We started the orginal iOS Haven in August 2017 and we have grown quite fast and now have built a community for ourselves. Our site is built for our community and is powered by them we run on 100% donations to keep the site alive.</p>

<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>Our mission is to not only provide an alternative app installer but also provide unsigned apps for our users here are some reasons why</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unsigned apps will never get revoked</li>
  <li>When apps do get revoked from AppValley, Tweakbox, etc you are safe</li>
  <li>Only con is having to resign every week</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have signed apps on our site for people who like things simple or don't have a computer to sign their own apps. We are adding new apps and games everyday to our site and we have all the ++ apps, tweaked apps, hacked games, cydia apps, and jailbreak apps all these apps both have a signed and unsigned download links.</p>
